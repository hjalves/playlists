# Playlists

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hjalves/playlists.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hjalves/playlists)

Web application to manage users and their favorite songs.


## TODO

This README is a work in progress. Sections missing:
- Project organization
- Configuration


## Features

- Manage users (with e-mail and name) and songs (title, artist, album)
- Organize users' favorite songs
- Web interface and RESTful API

### Demo instance

The following server is automatically deployed from the master branch:

> https://playlists-app.herokuapp.com

## Deployment

### Docker

Note: This method uses link which is a deprecated way of connecting containers.

```bash
# Run PostgreSQL instance
docker run --name postgres-pl -d postgres:9.6

# Run application (frontend + backend)
docker run --link postgres-pl:postgres -p 8080:80 -d hjalves/playlists:latest
```

### Frontend build script

Run `scripts/build-frontend.sh` to build a production version. The resulting
artifact is copied to `www` dir (the script stages the files to git).

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS-like)

Step-by-step:

- On project root, run: `eb init -p python3.4 <application_name>`
- Create an environment with: `eb create <environment_name>`
- Deploy project with: `eb deploy`

Note: Only the git committed files (in the HEAD commit) will be deployed.
To deploy files staged in git, use `eb deploy --staged`.


You should now have the application running at 
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


## Architecture and dependencies

This application is composed into two main components:

- **Backend**: Replies to HTTP requests (via RESTful API) and performs database
queries. It's built with Python (3.4+), Django and Django REST Framework.
It assumes an existing PostgreSQL instance (but it should work nicely
with other engines, at least SQLite).

- **Frontend**: User interface. It's a single-page application (SPA) 
coded in web technologies, more specifically ECMAScript 6, React, Bootstrap
and axios. It's located on [playlists_frontend/](playlists_frontend/).


## Development environment

### Backend (Python)

To setup a development environment, clone the repository,
install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/),
and run `vagrant up`, at the project root directory.

The default Vagrant setup installs a PostgreSQL server with a sample database
at: `postgresql://playlists:playlists@localhost:5432/playlists`.
If you have a Postgres instance already running on your machine, please change
the forwarded port `host: 5432` in `Vagrantfile`, or remove it altogether.

After the VM is up and running, connect it with `vagrant ssh` and:

- `~/run-server.sh`: to run the Django development server at port 8080
- `/vagrant/manage.py` to perform other management activities.

A Python virtual environment (located at `~/venv`, with the project
dependencies installed) is automatically activated as soon as you connect
via ssh (via `.bashrc`). If you prefer running the development server locally,
install Python 3.4+ (and virtualenv) and execute:

```bash
virtualenv -ppython3 venv       # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
source venv/bin/activate        # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements     # Install the project dependencies
./manage.py migrate             # Perform database migrations
./scripts/populate_db.py        # Insert test data in the database
./manage.py runserver           # Run the development server (port 8000)
```

### Frontend (Web)

The frontend is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/). To have a working
development environment and to build the production version 
you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
At the moment, the Vagrant provided does not include the required frontend
tools.

- In a console prompt (with npm available), run `cd playlists_frontend/`
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- `npm start` starts a development server


## Testing

To run the backend tests, activate the virtual environment (see previously)
and run `./manage.py test`.

Frontend does not have any tests.


## RESTful API

The API is loosely based on RESTful concepts. Both requests and responses
should be serialized and expected in JSON format. Some error responses
(with status code â‰  2xx) may be sent as HTML. All URI end in slash `/`.

There are Postman collections available at
[apitests/collections/](apitests/collections/).
